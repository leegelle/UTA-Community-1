# UTA-Community

NOTE: Login was devleoped by Hung Nyguen , and Registration was developed by Liiban. This was originally Yugal's task but due 
the fact that we didn't recieve any code from him until 12/08 we took it upon ourselves to develop those components on behalf 
of the team. This resulted in some aspects of the code not being finished such as messaging and minor bugs. Due to the code Yugal
being sent on the due date 12/08 we did not have time to incorporate it with our code and will be sending it separately
